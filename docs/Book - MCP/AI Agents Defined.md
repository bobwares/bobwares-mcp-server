##  **AI Agents Defined**
  
Autonomous software entities that perform tasks, make decisions, and collaborate with other agents or humans to achieve business goals, utilizing AI technologies for understanding and adaptation.

* **Key Components**

    * **Identity & Goals**: Defines who the agent is and what it aims to achieve.
    * **Override Control & Rules**: Safety mechanisms and governance policies.
    * **Memory**: Stores past interactions and experiences.
    * **Mental Model**: Internal representation of the environment for situational awareness.
    * **Knowledge Base**: Repository of facts, data, and learned information.
    * **Anticipation**: Predictive capability to prepare for future states.
    * **Actions**: Internal operations the agent can execute.
    * **Interface**: Means of communicating with users or other systems.
    * **Modalities**: Different channels (text, voice, vision) the agent can process or output.
    * **Planning**: Strategy formulation to reach goals.
    * **Execution Plan**: Step-by-step roadmap for enacting the plan.
    * **Tools**: External resources or APIs the agent can leverage.

* **Unique Aspects**
  Emphasizes the importance of a **Mental Model** for situational awareness, **Anticipation** for proactive behavior, and a clear distinction between **Actions** (internal operations) and **Tools** (external resources).

* **Holistic Approach**
  Unlike traditional models, this framework integrates **safety protocols**, **user expectations**, and **business objectives**, ensuring agents are reliable and aligned with their tasks.

* **Actionable Insights**

    1. **Define Clear Identities & Goals**: Establish who the agent is and what success looks like.
    2. **Implement Override Mechanisms**: Ensure safety and compliance through control rules.
    3. **Leverage Memory & Anticipation**: Use past data and predictions to improve interactions.
    4. **Differentiate Actions vs. Tools**: Clarify internal logic versus external capabilities.
    5. **Align with Business Objectives**: Integrate safety, user needs, and organizational goals from the start.
